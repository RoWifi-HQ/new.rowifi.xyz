# Verification

## Linking your account for the first time

To link your Roblox account to your Discord account, run the `/verify` command. The bot will then reply with a button
which takes you through the authentication process via Roblox. After this you can run the `/update` command.

## Adding another linked account

To link an additional Roblox account to your Discord account, run the `/verify` command. The process is the same as verifying for the first time.

## Setting a default account

To set an additional linked account as your default account, run the `/account default` command.

**NOTE**: This will set the given account as your default account in all new servers and in any servers where you have not
run `/account switch` explicitly.

## Switching accounts between servers

To use an additional linked account in a server, run the `/account switch` command and now, you have successfully switched your
account for that server. You can now run `/update` to get your roles.

## Unlinking an account

To unlink an account, run the command `/account delete`. You will now have successfully unlinked your Roblox account.
