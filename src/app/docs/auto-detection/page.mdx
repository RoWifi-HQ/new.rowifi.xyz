# Auto Detection

Auto Detection is a powerful feature designed to simplify server management by periodically updating 
every member in your server. This functionality ensures that roles, ranks, and other member-specific configurations 
remain accurate and up to date without requiring manual intervention. By automating these updates, Auto Detection 
helps server owners maintain consistency and reduce administrative overhead, making it an invaluable tool for large 
communities or servers with frequently changing membership.

## Availiability

Auto Detection is only available for Gamma Tier servers.
