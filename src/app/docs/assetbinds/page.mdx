# Assetbinds

Assetbinds are a type of bind that allow you to assign Discord roles to your members based on their ownership of a Roblox Asset.

An assetbind consists of four elements:

- **Asset**: The ID of the Asset
- **Type**: The Type of the Asset. This can be either be Asset, Badge or Gamepass
- **Template**: The composable element that is used to detemine the member's nickname. Learn more about it [here](/docs/template).
- **Priority**: A number that decides which template out of all the binds will be used. Learn more about it [here](/docs/priority).
