2. **Log In to Roblox:** Sign in with the Roblox account you want Tower to manage.
3. **Access Developer Tools:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open the Developer Console.
4. **Locate the Cookie:**
   - Navigate to the **Application** tab.
   - Under **Storage**, select **Cookies**.
   - Find the cookie named `.ROBLOSECURITY` and copy its value.
5. **Close the Browser Window:** To maintain account security, close the incognito window without logging out.
