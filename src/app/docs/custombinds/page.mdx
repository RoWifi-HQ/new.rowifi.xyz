# Custombinds

Custombinds are a type of bind that allow you to use our Lua-like scripting language to write highly customizable binds.

## Creating a Custombind

To create a single custombind, run the command `/custombinds new`.

It requires 3 arguments and has 2 optional arguments.

- **Code**: The code that evaluates to `true` or `false` based on the user.
- **Template**: Learn more about it [here](/docs/template).

#### Optional Arguments:

- **Priority**: Learn more about it [here](/docs/priority).
- **Discord Roles**: This is a list of Discord Roles that are to be added to the bind.

The syntax that custombinds use is modelled after Lua. The code, in essence, is an `if` statement of Lua. We recommend you to
use custombinds **ONLY** if you have previous experience with Lua.

We support the following operators:

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                                             | Aliases |
| :------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
|  `and`   | If both operands are true or non-zero, then condition becomes true                                                      |         |
|   `or`   | If any of the operands is true or non-zero, then condition becomes true                                                 |         |
|  `not`   | Used to reverse the logical value of the operand. If the condition is true, this operator makes it false and vice versa | !       |

### Relational Operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                        |
| :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `>`    | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand             |
|   `>=`   | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand |
|   `<`    | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand                |
|   `<=`   | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand    |
|   `==`   | Checks if the value of the left operand is equal to the value of the right operand                 |
|   `!=`   | Checks if the value of the left operand is not equal than the value of the right operand           |

### Functions

We support the following functions:

|          Function          | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    `IsInGroup(GroupId)`    | Checks if the user is present in the provided group. Returns a bool.                                                                                         |
| `HasRank(GroupId, RankId)` | Checks if the user has the provided rank in the provided group. Returns a bool.                                                                              |
|     `GetRank(GroupId)`     | Gives the rank id of the user in the provided group. Returns a number.                                                                                       |
|     `HasRole(RoleId)`      | Checks if the user has the provided role in the Discord server. Returns a bool.                                                                              |
|   `WithString("String")`   | Checks if the provided string is a substring of the user's Roblox Username. Returns a bool. <br/> **Note:** The `""` are necessary for the code to be valid. |

## Viewing your Custombinds

To view all your custombinds, run the command `/custombinds view`.

## Modifying a Custombind

Custombinds can be modified individually on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.rowifi.xyz).

## Deleting a custombind

Custombinds can be deleted using the [dashboard](https://dashboard.rowifi.xyz) or by the command `/custombinds delete`.

## Common Use Cases

### Division-less/Department-less Bind

To create a divisionless bind, we basically have to check whether the user is in the main group and not present in **ANY**
of the subgroups. The psuedocode for this is present below:

`IsInGroup(Main Group) and not IsInGroup(Sub Group 1) and not IsInGroup(Sub Group 2) ...`

Put as many `not IsInGroup(Sub Group N)` as many subgroups you have.
