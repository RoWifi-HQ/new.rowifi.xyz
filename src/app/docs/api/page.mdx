# RoWifi API

RoWifi's API is based around a HTTPS/REST API for all operations.

### Base URL
    
<div className="overflow-x-auto bg-neutral-900 whitespace-nowrap rounded-md scrollbar relative">
    <div className="px-3 w-full py-2">
        https://api.rowifi.xyz
    </div>
</div>

RoWifi has different versions of its API. You need to specify which version of the API you would like to use in your request path like `https://api.rowifi.xyz/v{version}`.

### API Versions

| Version | Status       |
| :-----: | ------------ |
|  3      | Active       |
|  2      | Deprecated   |
|  1      | Removed      |

## Authentication

Authenticating with the RoWifi API can be done only using the API tokens obtained from the Tokens page of the Dashboard. Authentication is performed with the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: Bot TOKEN`

## Rate Limiting

All endpoints currently follow the 5 per second per IP/token rule. This may change in the future and an announcement will be made as such.
