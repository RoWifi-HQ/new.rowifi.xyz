# Rankbinds

Rankbinds are a type of bind that allow you to assign Discord roles to your members based on their rank in Roblox Groups.

A rankbind consists of five elements:

- **Group**: The ID of your Roblox Group
- **Rank**: The ID of the rank in the Roblox Group. This will range from 1-255.
- **Template**: The composable element that is used to detemine the member's nickname. Learn more about it [here](/docs/template).
- **Priority**: A number that decides which template out of all the binds will be used. Learn more about it [here](/docs/priority).

### Availability

Rankbinds are available for all servers. You can create as many rankbinds as you want.
