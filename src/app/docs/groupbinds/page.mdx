# Groupbinds

Groupbinds are a type of bind that allow you to assign Discord roles to your members if they are present in a Roblox Group regardless of their rank.

A groupbind consists of five elements:

- **Group**: The ID of your Roblox Group
- **Template**: The composable element that is used to detemine the member's nickname. Learn more about it [here](/docs/template).
- **Priority**: A number that decides which template out of all the binds will be used. Learn more about it [here](/docs/priority).
