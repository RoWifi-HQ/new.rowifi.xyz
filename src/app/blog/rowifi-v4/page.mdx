# Launching V4

This release comes about 18 months after the last update. It includes a whole range of fixes, stability 
improvements, and key changes designed to enhance usability, streamline management, and modernize the 
overall experience. From refining permissions with Discord’s integrated tools to reorganizing and simplifying 
commands, this update represents a significant step forward for RoWifi.

In addition to addressing user feedback, we’ve made technical enhancements to improve reliability, introduced 
new features like server templates, and updated terminology to align with our commitment to inclusivity. Whether 
you’re managing a small community or a large server, these changes are designed to make RoWifi more intuitive 
and effective than ever before.

Let’s dive into the details of what’s new!

### Message Commands are Deleted

To align with Discord's evolving best practices, message commands have been fully removed. By focusing on slash commands, 
we aim to provide a more modern, user-friendly, and secure interaction system. This change also simplifies command usage, 
making it easier for users to discover and use features directly within the Discord interface. All sensitive slash commands
will require Administrator permissions by default. You can edit them by going to Server Settings > Integrations > RoWifi.
You can learn more about them at [Discord docs](https://support-apps.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/26501869403159-Command-Permissions).

Slash Commands Use Discord's Integrated Permissions
We’ve fully adopted Discord’s integrated permissions for slash commands. This change simplifies role-based access management. Server admins can now 
easily control who can use specific commands without the need for additional configuration within RoWifi.

### Admin and Trainer Roles are Deleted

The Admin and Trainer Roles were used to gate access for commands. However, with the use of the integrated Discord slash command permissions, 
these roles are no longer needed.

### Unified Bypass Roles

Bypass roles have been consolidated into a single, unified section for better organization. This feature now includes three types of bypass permissions:

All: Prevents the `/update` command from modifying anything.
Roles: Prevents the `/update` command from modifying roles.
Nickname: Prevents the `/update` command from modifying nickname.

### /xp view Renamed to /view xp

The /xp view command has been renamed to /view xp. This change ensures that the command operates outside the XP module's 
restrictive permissions, which govern sensitive commands.

### /settings, /reset, and /botinfo Commands Deleted

These commands have been removed as part of our effort to declutter the command interface. By retiring less frequently used commands, we can focus 
on improving and supporting the core functionality that matters.

### /xp bind Moved to /xpbinds

The /xp bind command has been relocated to /xpbinds to better organize XP-related commands. This change 
aims to maintain consistency with the other types of binds.

### Default Template Option for Servers

A new default template is now available for servers. This feature increases the configurability of the nicknaming process. All servers have been set
to have a default template of `{roblox-username}`.

### Blacklists Renamed to Denylists

We’ve renamed "blacklists" to "denylists" to align with more inclusive and descriptive terminology. This change reflects our commitment 
to clear and welcoming language throughout the platform.

### Debug Command for Troubleshooting
We’ve added a new /debug update command to help diagnose potential issues. This tool provides server admins with 
diagnostic feedback, making it easier to identify and resolve problems quickly that pop up while running the `/update` command.

### Increased Stability for Setrank and XP Commands

The setrank and XP commands have undergone significant stability improvements. These commands now execute more reliably
ensuring a smoother experience for all users.

### Reverse Search is Freely Available

We've removed the requirement of activating consent for reverse search. By removing this restriction, we’ve made this feature more 
convenient and universally available for servers for building additonal functionality.

### Custombinds Parsing and Evaluation Improved

The parsing and evaluation systems for custombinds have been enhanced to provide more accurate and efficient performance. This update 
ensures that the custombind code behave as expected, reducing errors and improving usability.

### Alpha Tier Deprecated

The Alpha Tier has been officially retired. All customers paying for Alpha Tier may stay on the tier without disruption.

### Patreon Deletion Scheduled for March 31, 2025

Support for Patreon will be discontinued on March 31, 2025. We are now requiring all patrons to transition to Lemonsqueezy by the aforementioned date.
